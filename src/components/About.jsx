          I'm <strong>Marlon Acosta</strong> and I want to introduce you to this
          web application that I was able to develop during the soyHenry
          bootcamp, I really enjoyed the development process of this project
          since I was improving my skills in React, and learning some new ones
          such as styled Components. In weatherApp you can find information
          about the weather of different cities around the world.ðŸ™ŒðŸš€

      </AboutMe>
      <img src={webDeveloper} alt="Web Developer" />
    </AboutContainer>
  );
}
